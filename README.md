# Valentine's Day Survey Analysis

This repository contains the data and Tableau visualization for a survey conducted in the UK in 2015, exploring the perspectives of men and women regarding the significance of Valentine's Day.

## Overview

Valentine's Day is celebrated worldwide as a day of love and affection, often marked by exchanging gifts, romantic gestures, and expressions of appreciation. This project aims to analyze the viewpoints of both men and women on the purpose and significance of Valentine's Day.

## Data Source

The data for this analysis was collected through a survey conducted in the UK in 2015. The survey gathered responses from both men and women, capturing their opinions on various aspects of Valentine's Day.

## Tableau Visualization

The Tableau visualization presents an interactive exploration of the survey results, highlighting the differences in perceptions between men and women regarding Valentine's Day. The visualization is divided into two main sections:

1. **Women percentage greater than men**
   - Shows the ratings given by women for different aspects of Valentine's Day, such as showing care, self-treatment, and gift-giving.
   - Emphasizes emotional connections and expressions of affection.

2. **Men percentage greater than women**
   - Displays the ratings provided by men for various elements of Valentine's Day, including going out for dinner, impressing someone, and receiving gifts.
   - Highlights physical intimacy and validation.

## Insights

Based on the analysis of the survey data and visualization, the following insights can be drawn:

- Women tend to prioritize emotional connection and expressions of affection on Valentine's Day, as reflected in their ratings for showing care and self-treatment.
- Men, on the other hand, focus more on physical intimacy and validation, with higher ratings for activities like going out for dinner and impressing someone.
